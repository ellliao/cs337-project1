## IMDB setup

You'll need to download the appropriate IMDB datasets to run this code. I've included a shell script that will set this up for you.

 Simply go to **Terminal** or the equivalent on your device and run the following from within this project directory:

 ```
 bash ./imdb_setup.sh
 ```
 
 The Python code will handle the rest. For further documentation on the IMDB datasets, see the [IMDB page](https://developer.imdb.com/non-commercial-datasets/).
